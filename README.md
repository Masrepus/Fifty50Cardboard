# Fifty50Cardboard
An Android app to view Fifty50 livestream in VR with Google Cardboard</br>
A simple first-person-view Android app that allows you to view the camera livestream the <a href="http://github.com/Masrepus/Fifty50">Fifty50 Lego Racer</a> provides - on your Google Cardboard.</br>
Additionally it sends commands to the car when you move your head! If you turn left, the car also drives left etc.
Currently there is no "real" VR feeling because Fifty50 only provides the livestream of a single camera (so what is done here is simply displaying the same camera feed on both eyes), but still it is a fun way of experiencing Fifty50 from a first person point of view. You can either use it as a passive spectator or actively control the car.
